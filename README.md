You can spawn horcrux in the vicinity by pressing #F button. The horcrux gets spawned at any one of the target points in the area. Once you have picked the horcrux, you need to put it in the goblet. It will burn once inside of it. 
Also, you will be incremented with a score. 
The timer, keeps running above the head.
